# .NET Core Libraries (CoreFX)

This repo contains the library implementation (called "CoreFX") for .NET Core. It includes System.Collections, System.IO, System.Xml, and many other components.
The corresponding [.NET Core Runtime repo](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr) (called "CoreCLR") contains the runtime implementation for .NET Core. It includes RyuJIT, the .NET GC, and many other components.
Runtime-specific library code ([mscorlib](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/tree/master/src/mscorlib)) lives in the CoreCLR repo. It needs to be built and versioned in tandem with the runtime. The rest of CoreFX is agnostic of runtime-implementation and can be run on any compatible .NET runtime (e.g. [CoreRT](https://github.com/dotnet/corert)).

  * [Install official releases](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)
  * [Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet) (Get Started, Tutorials, Porting from .NET Framework, API reference, ...)
    * [Deploying apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/preview3/deploying)
* [Roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md)
* [Releases](https://github.com/dotnet/core/tree/master/release-notes)
* [Bringing more APIs to .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/porting.md) (and why some APIs will be left out)



## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file bugs, join in design conversations, and fix issues.

* [Dogfooding daily builds](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/dogfooding.md)
* If you have a question or idea, [file a new issue](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/new).

If you are having issues with the "full" .NET Framework (also called "Desktop"), the best way to file a bug is at [Connect](http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio) or through [Product Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus?ws=support) if you have a contract.

## Get Started

If you're new to .NET Core and have 10 minutes to try it, start here: 
- [What is .NET Core?](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/platform)
- [Get Started with the Official releases of .NET Core on Windows, OSX and Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core)

If you have some more time and want to go deeper or get the latest builds:
- [Get the latest builds of .NET Core on Windows, OSX and Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/blob/master/README.md)
- [Get the latest builds of ASP.NET Core on Windows, OSX and Linux](https://github.com/aspnet/home)

## .NET Core Platform

The .NET Core platform is made of several components, which includes the
managed compilers, the runtime, the base class libraries, and numerous application models such as
ASP.NET.

* [Roadmap](roadmap.md)
* [.NET Core Framework](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)
* [.NET Core Runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)
* [.NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn")](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn)
* [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/home)

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

All projects accept contributions:

* [.NET Core Contributing Guide](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/project-docs/contributing.md)
* [.NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn")](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Contributing-Code)
* [ASP.NET Contributing Guide](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

You are also encouraged to start a discussion by posting on the
[.NET Foundation Forums](http://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/) or filing an
issue in the corresponding GitHub project. See the contributing guides for more
details.

## .NET Foundation

The .NET Core platform is part of the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects).

* [.NET Core Project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/net-core)
* [.NET Compiler Platform ("Roslyn" Project)](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/net-compiler-platform-roslyn)
* [ASP.NET Core Project](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/asp-net-core)

## Licenses

.NET Core platform projects typically use either the [MIT](LICENSE.TXT) or
[Apache 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) licenses for code.

## Understanding the relationship between .NET Core and the .NET Framework

.NET Core and the .NET Framework have (for the most part) a subset-superset
relationship. .NET Core is named "Core" since it contains the core features from
the .NET Framework, for both the runtime and framework libraries. For example,
.NET Core and the .NET Framework share the GC, the JIT and types such as
`String` and `List<T>`.

.NET Core was created so that .NET could be open source, cross platform and be
used in more resource-constrained environments. We have also published a subset
of the [.NET Reference Source](https://github.com/Microsoft/referencesource)
under the MIT license, so that you and the community can port additional .NET
Framework features to .NET Core.

## Understanding the relationship between .NET Core and Mono

Mono is an important part of the .NET ecosystem, particularly for client
scenarios (for example, Xamarin). We will look for ways to collaborate with Mono
developers and encourage them to take our code to improve Mono. We will also
look for opportunities to improve .NET Core with MIT-licensed Mono code.

An important collaboration opportunity is making .NET Core NuGet packages
(produced from this code) work on Mono. The SIMD NuGet package is a perfect
example.

## Learning about ASP.NET and .NET Core

[ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/aspnet/home) is a new cross-platform version of
ASP.NET that is designed for the cloud, and runs on Windows, Linux and Mac. It
targets .NET Core by default, but you may choose to target the .NET Framework on
Windows.
